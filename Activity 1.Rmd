# 3.1

  Overall my favorite food is definitely sushi, but that is a broad food group. Some of my favorite types of sushi rolls include...
  
 
  
  
  * California Roll
    + Spicy California
    + Normal California
  * Unagi Roll
  * Rainbow Roll
  * Spicy Tuna Roll
  * Alaska Roll

  
  My favorite place to get sushi is a restaraunt called Midori in my hometown Chicago, Illinois. At Midori every meal comes with a starting of complimentary appetizers that are delicious. The order of appetizers goes...
  
  1. Green tea
  2. Miso Soup
  3. Green Beans with their spicy sauce
  4. Mushrooms with their spicy sauce
  5. Ginger salad
  
  Of course nothing beats when you see this boat of all the best sushi rolls Chicago has to offer on the way to your table...
